This project uses Citibike data from June 2019 and June 2020 to make observations about how consumer behavior during the Covid pandemic might have affected overall patterns in bike sharing. 

Initially, my plan was to merge CSVs for each month in 2019 and 2020, to see how bike sharing patterns changed throughout each “stage” of the pandemic. I decided to limit my data to only one month of each year, since I’m new to Tableau and wanted to focus my efforts there instead of spending most of my time merging the datasets. 

I imported June 2019 and June 2020 CSVs and created a union between them, since most of the visualizations are using year-over-year data.

Even though I only used 2 months worth of Citibike data, Tableau was extremely slow in processing the data into my visualizations, which made the project much more challenging than it probably should have been. For future projects, I would look into ways to reduce this processing time.
